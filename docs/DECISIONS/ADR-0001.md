# ADR-0001: Adopt oclif for CLI

Status
- Accepted

Context
- Command surface will expand; OSS contributions expected; need generators, plugins, and clear structure.

Decision
- Use oclif (TypeScript) with generators for commands/topics and a plugin-friendly layout.

Consequences
- Faster onboarding, consistent scaffolding, and simpler long-term maintenance.
- Slightly higher framework overhead vs minimal parsers; trade-off accepted for scalability.
