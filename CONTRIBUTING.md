# Contributing to RegistryAccord Specifications

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the RegistryAccord protocol\! We are in an early, formative stage, and we welcome feedback and ideas from the community to help us build a robust and fair economic layer for the creator economy.

This document provides a set of guidelines to help you get started.

### Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/RegistryAccord/registryaccord-cli-ts/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior.

### How Can I Contribute?

As we are in the "Architect Phase," the most valuable contributions are discussions and feedback on the core concepts of the protocol.

### **Reporting Bugs and Suggesting Enhancements**

The best way to provide feedback is by opening a **GitHub Issue**.

  * **Check existing issues** before opening a new one to see if your topic is already being discussed.
  * If you're reporting a bug, please include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce it.
  * If you're suggesting an enhancement or a change to the specification, please describe the problem you're trying to solve and your proposed solution.

### **Proposing Changes with Pull Requests**

For those who want to contribute directly to the specification files, we follow a standard GitHub workflow:

1.  **Fork** the `registryaccord-specs` repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Create a new branch** for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/add-profile-schema`).
3.  **Make your changes** to the relevant files.
4.  **Sign your work** (see Developer Certificate of Origin below).
5.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch of the official repository.
6.  In your PR description, please provide a clear explanation of the changes and link to any relevant GitHub Issues.

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

To ensure that contributions are properly licensed, we use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). Every commit you make must be "signed off" by including a `Signed-off-by` line in the commit message.

You can do this automatically by using the `-s` flag with your git commit command:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: add schema for user profiles"
```

This will add a line to your commit message like:

`Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>`

By signing your work, you are certifying that you have the right to contribute the code under the project's license.
